# Hoard
Gold and currency display DataBroker module for World of Warcraft.

## Description
Hoard is a gold and currency DataBroker display module. Now you may ask, why would you want yet another one of these?

Gold module tracks gold across all of your chars on same (connected) realm and also displays some session and history data about profits and losses. The gold module will also track when you send gold in mail to alts and doesn't mark the money sent as losses. If you care about that sort of a thing.

Currency module will allow you to track your characters' currencies up to four currencies at a time. By default it will display a global profile but you can change that to per character profile instead.

## Dependencies
Hoard uses Ace3, LibQTip and LibDataBroker which are included in the /libs directory.
